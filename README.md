What's boxed up in that box in the corner from when I moved?

Don't you wish you could pack like you were in the 21st century.

### Instructions for Use:
1. Install app
2. Get moving boxes.
3. Put stuff in box.
4. Before you close, snap a photo and upload it to the app, add a description if you want so you can search for indiviual items easier later. 
5. When you close it, write the box ID onto the box.
